TODO File for netreconn toolsl; asterisk  marks target(s) for next release
nstrobe:
- BUG: hostname-NUMBER counts up until number is reached from the hostname.
       Not really sure if that is a bug or feature???
nlist:
- portability testing on netbsd, freebsd, debian and ubuntu *
new stuff:
- etherdump raw dumper tool or add to ntraf
- arpdumper tool or add to ntraf
nstrobe:
- better perhost timers
- if practical a true pre-ping using ICMP versus a full connect
- Support for user to change TCP flags in both directions
- Something like top-ports or popular ports to increase performance
- capability to do more than class C scoped addresses (not a drop dead item)
ntraf and/or ndecode:
- write handling and identification and printing for all common well
  defined IP protocols; this will take a lot of work as it requires 
  delaing with each data struct
